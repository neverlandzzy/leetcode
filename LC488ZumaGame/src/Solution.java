	 * Think about Zuma Game. You have a row of balls on the table, colored red(R), yellow(Y), blue(B), green(G), and white(W). 
	 * You also have several balls in your hand.
	 * 
	 * Each time, you may choose a ball in your hand, and insert it into the row (including the leftmost place and rightmost place). 
	 * Then, if there is a group of 3 or more balls in the same color touching, remove these balls. Keep doing this until no more balls 
	 * can be removed.
	 * 
	 * Find the minimal balls you have to insert to remove all the balls on the table. If you cannot remove all the balls, output -1.
	 * 
	 * Examples:
	 * 
	 * Input: "WRRBBW", "RB"
	 * Output: -1
	 * Explanation: WRRBBW -> WRR[R]BBW -> WBBW -> WBB[B]W -> WW
	 * 
	 * Input: "WWRRBBWW", "WRBRW"
	 * Output: 2
	 * Explanation: WWRRBBWW -> WWRR[R]BBWW -> WWBBWW -> WWBB[B]WW -> WWWW -> empty
	 * 
	 * Input:"G", "GGGGG"
	 * Output: 2
	 * Explanation: G -> G[G] -> GG[G] -> empty 
	 * 
	 * Input: "RBYYBBRRB", "YRBGB"
	 * Output: 3
	 * Explanation: RBYYBBRRB -> RBYY[Y]BBRRB -> RBBBRRB -> RRRB -> B -> B[B] -> BB[B] -> empty 
	 * 
	 * Note:
	 * 1. You may assume that the initial row of balls on the table wonâ€™t have any 3 or more consecutive balls with the same color.
	 * 2. The number of balls on the table won't exceed 20, and the string represents these balls is called "board" in the input.
	 * 3. The number of balls in your hand won't exceed 5, and the string represents these balls is called "hand" in the input.
	 * 4. Both input strings will be non-empty and only contain characters 'R','Y','B','G','W'.
