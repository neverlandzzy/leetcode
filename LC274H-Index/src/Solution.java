	 * his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than 
	 * h citations each."
	 * 
	 * For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher has 5 papers in 
	 * total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. Since the researcher 
	 * has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations 
	 * each, his h-index is 3.
	 * 
	 * Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
